  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Data Engineer with hands-on experience building and maintaining
    batch and streaming pipelines on Google Cloud Platform.
    My work focuses on correctness, performance, and operational simplicity.
  </p>

  <p>
    I regularly work with <strong>Apache Beam</strong>,
    <strong>Cloud Composer (Airflow)</strong>, and <strong>BigQuery</strong>,
    solving problems where scale and data quality truly matter.
