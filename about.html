      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I am <strong>Ankit Mohan Pandey</strong>, a <strong>Data Engineer</strong> with hands-on
        experience in designing, building, and maintaining scalable, reliable
        data platforms on Google Cloud Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work primarily on batch and streaming data pipelines, focusing on
        performance, data quality, and system reliability. My day-to-day work
        involves building pipelines using Apache Beam, orchestrating workflows
        with Cloud Composer (Airflow), and designing analytics-ready data models
        in BigQuery.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy working on problems where data volume, correctness, and latency
        matter, and I strongly believe in building systems that are simple,
        observable, and easy to operate at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond implementation, I actively focus on system design trade-offs,
        writing clean and maintainable code, improving pipeline reliability,
        and continuously learning modern data engineering practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website is my space to document learnings, share technical insights,
        and explain complex data engineering concepts in a simple and practical way.
