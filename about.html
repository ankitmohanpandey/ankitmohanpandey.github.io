<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="section container">
  <h2>My Journey</h2>

  <p>
    I am a Data Engineer with hands-on experience building and maintaining
    batch and streaming pipelines on Google Cloud Platform.
    My work focuses on correctness, performance, and operational simplicity.
  </p>

  <p>
    I regularly work with Apache Beam for pipeline development,
    Cloud Composer (Airflow) for orchestration,
    and BigQuery for analytical data modeling.
    I enjoy solving problems where scale and data quality truly matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe good data systems are not just fast,
    but easy to understand, monitor, and evolve over time.
